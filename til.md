### Gay Hendrick's genius move

1. Any time you **notice** any sort of unhappiness in you...
2. Ask, **what am I trying to control** that is not in my power to control
3. Sometimes you get an immediate **insight**, if not spend time thoughtfully wondering
4. Formally declare it outside of your control; let it go, let it be. Now, **think of a positive action you have control over and take it**
